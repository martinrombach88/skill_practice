1. replace react-native-cli with latest version of
react native community cli
2. use a react native typescript template
3. add a library for vector icons 
-> gradle for android and 'info.plist' for ios
(copied a list of fonts) 

SafeAreaView -> IOS only boundaries component, 
safe are can't be breached by content

Makes comments where components will exist

Pixel values for margin, borders

Googles color picker (bing doesn't have it :/)

Solved problem of overflowing text with
flex 1 and limiting numberOfLines attribute of 
Text to 3, which truncates text (words words...)

Uses flex 2 / 3 to split columns in a component

resizeMode (equivalent of object-fit)
resizeMode: contain -> goes max size,
leaves white space if height incorrect
resizeMode: cover -> goes max size,
crops part of the picture if it won't fit

Uses a vector icons directory to get
5 rating stars (icons) to add to a project,
he uses fontawesome to make the final 
stars

Margin/Padding Vertical / Horizontal
does both sides (like 0% 2%)

Picker library for drop downs

Uses Math.max(0, quantity -1)); to create a min
of 0 for a value button


If you aren't sure of an object's padding
add a red background
