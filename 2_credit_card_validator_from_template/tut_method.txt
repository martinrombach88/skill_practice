Aphrx method:

1. Install libraries:

react-credit-cards,
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-credit-cards 

card-validator
https://www.npmjs.com/package/card-validator

//-> A retread with JS and no libraries could be good (see online tutorial?)

2 Import the Card component from
react credit cards. This component
checks the card number in it's object
field and changes it's styling to suit.

3. Use the react app css files to style
the form, making changes only if you need to.

4. Create a form with the fields. Submission is 'Validate'

5. Create a custom hook called 'UseForm' that handles the values of the fields.

6. Create another hook (does this count as a hook? not just a class?) called ValidateInfo that uses
the card-validator library.
